# Natours-Project

Course-project that focusses on advanced css and scss techniques. 
The project is built with floats. This as a training to be able to work with older css-codebases as well.


Used technologies:
- css, scss (sass)
- html

I have not yet finished the project but i have deployed the current version already for observation purposes.
